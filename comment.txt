Comparison of Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec

In this project, I compared three text vectorization methods: Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec. The goal was to represent product descriptions in a numerical way and see how they separate visually based on categories.

Bag of Words give a very simple representation. It counts how many times each word appears, but doesn’t consider meaning or context. The results were okay, but the clusters weren’t very clear.

TF-IDF improves on that by giving more weight to important words. The visualization was slightly better, and categories started to show more separation.

Word2Vec clearly gave the best result. Since it captures the semantic relationships between words, the different product types were more clearly grouped in the plot.

Overall, Word2Vec provided the most useful and accurate representation of the descriptions, and the PCA visualization looked more structured with it.
